Basic Questions
What is Node.js?

Answer: Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code outside of a browser. It is designed to build scalable network applications and is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
What are the main features of Node.js?

Answer:
Asynchronous and Event-Driven: All APIs of Node.js library are asynchronous.
Single-Threaded but Highly Scalable: Node.js uses a single-threaded model with event looping.
Fast Execution: Built on the V8 JavaScript engine, it executes code very quickly.
No Buffering: Node.js applications output data in chunks.
Core Concepts
Explain the event-driven architecture of Node.js.

Answer: Node.js operates on a single-threaded event loop. It handles concurrent operations without creating multiple threads by using events and callbacks. This makes it highly efficient for I/O operations.
What is the difference between process.nextTick() and setImmediate()?

Answer: process.nextTick() defers the execution of a function until the next pass around the event loop or when the event loop is about to end. setImmediate() executes a function after the current event loop cycle.
Asynchronous Programming
How do you handle asynchronous operations in Node.js?
Answer: Asynchronous operations in Node.js can be handled using callbacks, promises, and async/await.
javascript
Copy code
// Using Callbacks
fs.readFile('file.txt', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data);
});

// Using Promises
fs.promises.readFile('file.txt')
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));

// Using Async/Await
async function readFile() {
  try {
    const data = await fs.promises.readFile('file.txt');
    console.log(data);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
}
readFile();
Modules and Dependencies
What is the purpose of the package.json file?

Answer: The package.json file is used to manage the metadata of the project, including the project name, version, description, main entry point, scripts, author, license, and dependencies.
How do you use the require function in Node.js?

Answer: The require function is used to include modules in Node.js. It reads a JavaScript file, executes it, and returns the export object.
javascript
Copy code
const fs = require('fs');
const data = fs.readFileSync('file.txt');
console.log(data.toString());
Express.js
What is Express.js?

Answer: Express.js is a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js. It provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications, such as routing, middleware, and template engines.
How do you define a route in Express.js?

Answer: Routes in Express.js are defined using methods of the app object corresponding to HTTP methods.
javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
Error Handling
How do you handle errors in Node.js?
Answer: Errors in Node.js can be handled using try-catch blocks, error-first callbacks, and event emitters. Proper error handling ensures that the application remains robust and does not crash unexpectedly.
Performance and Optimization
How do you optimize the performance of a Node.js application?
Answer:
Use asynchronous code and avoid blocking the event loop.
Implement efficient error handling.
Use Node.js clustering to take advantage of multi-core systems.
Cache static assets and use CDNs.
Monitor and analyze performance with tools like PM2, New Relic, or AppDynamics.
Security
How do you ensure security in a Node.js application?
Answer:
Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
Regularly update dependencies to patch vulnerabilities.
Use environment variables for sensitive data.
Implement proper authentication and authorization.
Advanced Topics
What is the event loop in Node.js?

Answer: The event loop is a mechanism that Node.js uses to handle asynchronous operations. It allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations by offloading operations to the system kernel whenever possible.
Explain the concept of streams in Node.js.

Answer: Streams are objects that let you read data from a source or write data to a destination in a continuous fashion. There are four types of streams in Node.js: Readable, Writable, Duplex, and Transform.
What are buffers in Node.js?

Answer: Buffers are used to handle binary data in Node.js. They are particularly useful when dealing with streams of data such as reading from a file or receiving packets over a network.
